This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setting up this project

First, clone the repository into a directory of your choice, and run

```
cd react-appium-app-inspector
npm install
```

## Running the project

Once you have done `npm install`, you need to start both the backend express JS module as well as the front end react module.

### Start the backend

```
cd react-appium-app-inspector (if you haven't done so yet)
node server.js
```

The backend now runs on http://localhost:5000

### Start the Frontend

In a new terminal

```
cd react-appium-app-inspector (if you haven't done so yet)
npm start
```

The front end now runs on http://localhost:3000
